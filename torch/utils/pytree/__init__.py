"""
Contains utility functions for working with nested python data structures.

A *pytree* is Python nested data structure. It is a tree in the sense that
nodes are Python collections (e.g., list, tuple, dict) and the leaves are
Python values. Furthermore, a pytree should not contain reference cycles.

pytrees are useful for working with nested collections of Tensors. For example,
one can use `tree_map` to map a function over all Tensors inside some nested
collection of Tensors and `tree_leaves` to get a flat list of all Tensors
inside some nested collection. pytrees are helpful for implementing nested
collection support for PyTorch APIs.

        flatten_func (callable): A function to be used during flattening, taking an instance of
            ``cls`` and returning a pair, with (1) an iterable for the children to be flattened
            recursively, and (2) some hashable auxiliary data to be stored in the treespec and to be
            passed to the ``unflatten_func``.
        unflatten_func (callable): A function taking two arguments: the unflattened children, and
            the auxiliary data that was returned by ``flatten_func`` and stored in the treespec.
            The function should return an instance of ``cls``.
        serialized_type_name (str, optional): A keyword argument used to specify the fully
            qualified name used when serializing the tree spec.
        to_dumpable_context (callable, optional): An optional keyword argument to custom specify how
            to convert the context of the pytree to a custom json dumpable representation. This is
            used for json serialization, which is being used in :mod:`torch.export` right now.
        from_dumpable_context (callable, optional): An optional keyword argument to custom specify
            how to convert the custom json dumpable representation of the context back to the
            original context. This is used for json deserialization, which is being used in
            :mod:`torch.export` right now.
